# TrustNest
TrustNest is a smart accommodation finder that helps users discover verified flats, PGs, and hostels using location, budget, and amenity preferences. I developed the JavaFX front-end and handled local data storage. The system offers smooth browsing, listing management, and intelligent AI-based recommendations.
